# Used Car Price Prediction

Introduction
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as the year of manufacture, the current ex-showroom price, kilometers driven, and more. The predictions are made using different machine learning models, and the performance of these models is evaluated to determine the best approach.

Dataset Description
The dataset cars.csv includes the following features:

Name: The name of the car.
Year: The year the car was manufactured.
Selling_Price: The price at which the car is being sold.
Present_Price: The current ex-showroom price of the car.
Kms_Driven: The distance the car has been driven, in kilometers.
Fuel_Type: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
Seller_Type: Indicates whether the seller is a dealer or an individual.
Transmission: Specifies if the car has a manual or automatic transmission.
Owner: The number of previous owners.
Model Training and Evaluation Process
The notebook Used cars Price Prediction.ipynb includes the following steps:

Data Exploration:

Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Visualizing distributions and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Training various machine learning models to predict car prices.
Models include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
Metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
Results
The performance of the trained models is evaluated based on the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors, giving a higher weight to larger errors.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable.
R-squared (R2): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
These metrics provide insights into how well the models are performing in predicting car prices.
